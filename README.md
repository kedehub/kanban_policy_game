# Kanban Policy Game

## Introduction

The Kanban Policy Game is a fun way to experience how policies affect [collaboration](https://docs.kedehub.io/kede/kede-collaboration.html) and then [productivity](https://docs.kedehub.io/kede/kede-productivity.html). 

The principle of bounded rationality formulated by Herbert Simon states that the capacity of the human mind for formulating and solving complex problems is very small 
compared with the size of the problems whose solution is required for objectively rational behavior in the real world. 
Simon defines a ""triangle of limits'':

- the individual is limited by skills, habits, and reflexes;
- by values or conceptions of purpose which may diverge from organizational goals;
- by the extent of knowledge and information possessed

Fortunately, an organization can alter the limits to rationality of its members by creating policies that change the organizational environment in which the individual's decision making takes place.

As Kenneth Arrow said: “An organization can acquire more information than any one individual, for it can have each member perform different experiments. 
Thus, the limitations on an individual's capacity are overcome.”

> When establishing the policies of an organization the goal is to overcome the cognitive limits of individuals.

[Collaboration](https://docs.kedehub.io/kede/kede-collaboration.html) is a [knowledge discovery process](https://docs.kedehub.io/kede/what-is-kede-derivation.html#knowledge-discovery-process) that acquires missing information only from personal sources.

The goal of the Kanban Policy Game is to let people practice evolutionary change of the policies that use a [knowledge discovery process](https://docs.kedehub.io/kede/what-is-kede-derivation.html#knowledge-discovery-process).
