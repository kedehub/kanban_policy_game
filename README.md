# Kanban Policy Game

## Introduction

The Kanban Policy Game is a fun way to experience how policies affect [collaboration](https://docs.kedehub.io/kede/kede-collaboration.html) and then [productivity](https://docs.kedehub.io/kede/kede-productivity.html). The goal of the Kanban Policy Game is to let people practice evolutionary change of a [knowledge discovery process](https://docs.kedehub.io/kede/what-is-kede-derivation.html#knowledge-discovery-process).

The principle of bounded rationality formulated by Herbert Simon states that the capacity of the human mind for formulating and solving complex problems is very small 
compared with the size of the problems whose solution is required for objectively rational behavior in the real world. 
Simon defines a ""triangle of limits'':

- the individual is limited by skills, habits, and reflexes;
- by values or conceptions of purpose which may diverge from organizational goals;
- by the extent of knowledge and information possessed

Fortunately, an organization can alter the limits to rationality of its members by creating policies that change the organizational environment in which the individual's decision making takes place.

As Kenneth Arrow said: “An organization can acquire more information than any one individual, for it can have each member perform different experiments. 
Thus, the limitations on an individual's capacity are overcome.”

> When establishing the policies of an organization the goal is to overcome the cognitive limits of individuals.

In the game the following policies will be evolved:
- Collaboration Policy
- Pull Policy
- WIP Policy 

## Learning outcomes

- “Collaboration Policy”, “Performance Evaluation Policy” and “WIP Policy” have huge impact on productivity.
- Limiting WIP when we measure individual performance has a negative effect on the productivity of the team as a whole.
- Limiting WIP when we don't measure individual performance has a positive effect on the productivity of the team as a whole.
- With strong collaboration irrespective of WIP limits, Throughput is close to the highest possible values.
- When we limit WIP in a no-collaboration context, then Throughput goes down.
- A team needs only strong collaboration to achieve good Throughput and Lead Time – highly unlikely to get poor performance by chance. 
- To achieve shortest possible Lead Time strong collaboration is not enough – WIP must be limited as well.
